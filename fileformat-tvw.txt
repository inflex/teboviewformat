PAD table:
type/details	 | description
----------------------------------------
***NOTHING KNOWN ABOUT THIS YET***
I'm purely speculating that this table exists based on the part->pin array index uint32 and that changing that value changes the 


PIN entry:
type/details	| description
----------------------------------------
uint32			Pad index number.  if you change this up/down by 8, it'll move the pin number string back/forth on the rendered display. Does NOT change the network or other details about the pad, so appears to be only for populating the pad name/id string.

uint32			unknown (0)
uint32			integer pin index (1-based, ie, 1, 2, 3...n)
string			pin name (1, 2, 3 etc for small parts, or AA42, B24 etc for BGA)
uint32			unknown (0)


Pin network ID entry:
	Uint32 network/pin index ID, unsure of constraints
			For all currently examined files, this ID always increments in steps of 8.  It's not gauranteed that the ID is sequentially updated with the pin count on the part, but it does seem that they're always unique. 

			Unsure why the mechanics of this ID have been selected, there's likely a good reason but at this point unsure.   This is the key sticking point for making an initial boardview decoding. We need to determine how to map these IDs to the network names.
